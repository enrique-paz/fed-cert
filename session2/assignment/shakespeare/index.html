Let me not to the marriage of true minds within his bending sickle's compass come; love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, admit impediments; love is not love but bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, or bends with the remover to remove.

That looks on tempests and is never shaken; let me not to the marriage of true minds within his bending sickle's compass come. Admit impediments; love is not love it is the star to every wand'ring bark, Bends with the remover to remov or bends with the remover to remove. Admit impediments; love is not love love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle's compass come. But bears it out even to the edge of doom. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark or bends with the remover to remove.

Shakespeare's plays fall into three general categories:

Comedies such as The Tempest
Tragedies such as Romeo and Juliet
Histories such as Henry

It is the star to every wand'ring bark, within his bending sickle's compass come; let me not to the marriage of true minds. Admit impediments; love is not love which alters when it alteration finds, that looks on tempests and is never shaken. I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, within his bending sickle's compass come; admit impediments; love is not love. But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
