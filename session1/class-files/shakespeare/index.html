Home Biography Sonnets Plays
Let me not to the marriage of true minds within his bending sickle's compass come; love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, admit impediments; love is not love but bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, or bends with the remover to remove.

That looks on tempests and is never shaken; let me not to the marriage of true minds within his bending sickle's compass come. Admit impediments; love is not love it is the star to every wand'ring bark, Bends with the remover to remov or bends with the remover to remove. Admit impediments; love is not love love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle's compass come. But bears it out even to the edge of doom. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark or bends with the remover to remove.

		Shakespeare's plays fall into three general categories:

	Comedies such as The Tempest
	Tragedies such as Romeo and Juliet
		Histories such as Henry

It is the star to every wand'ring bark, within his bending sickle's compass come; let me not to the marriage of true minds. Admit impediments; love is not love which alters when it alteration finds, that looks on tempests and is never shaken. I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, within his bending sickle's compass come; admit impediments; love is not love. But bears it out even to the edge of doom.

	Sonnets

    The primary source of Shakespeare’s sonnets is a quarto published in 1609 titled Shake-speare’s Sonnets. It contains 154 sonnets, which are followed by the long poem "A Lover's Complaint". Thirteen copies of the quarto have survived in fairly good shape from the 1609 edition, which is the only edition; there were no other printings. There is evidence in a note on the title page of one of the extant copies that the great Elizabethan actor Edward Alleyn bought a copy in June 1609 for one shilling.

The sonnets cover such themes as the passage of time, love, infidelity, jealousy, beauty and mortality. The first 126 are addressed to a young man; the last 28 are either addressed to, or refer to a woman. (Sonnets 138 and 144 had previously been published in the 1599 miscellany The Passionate Pilgrim).

The title of the quarto, Shakespeare’s Sonnets, is consistent with the entry in the Stationer Register. The title appears in upper case lettering on the title page, where it is followed by the phrase “Neuer before Imprinted”. The title also appears every time the quarto is opened. That the author’s name in a possessive form is part of the title sets it apart from all other sonnet collections of the time, except for one—Sir Philip Sidney’s posthumous 1591 publication that is titled, Syr. P.S. his Astrophel and Stella, which is considered one of Shakespeare’s most important models. Sidney’s title may have inspired Shakespeare, particularly if the “W.H.” of Shakespeare’s dedication is Sidney’s nephew and heir, William Herbert. The idea that the persona referred to as the speaker of the Shakespeare’s sonnets might be Shakespeare himself, is aggressively repudiated by scholars, however, the title of the quarto does seem to encourage that kind of speculation.

The first 17 poems, traditionally called the procreation sonnets, are addressed to the young man—urging him to marry and have children in order to immortalize his beauty by passing it to the next generation.[4] Other sonnets express the speaker's love for the young man; brood upon loneliness, death, and the transience of life; seem to criticise the young man for preferring a rival poet; express ambiguous feelings for the speaker's mistress; and pun on the poet's name. The final two sonnets are allegorical treatments of Greek epigrams referring to the "little love-god" Cupid.
